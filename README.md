The Wine Quality Prediction project is a Python-based application that leverages machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. By analyzing datasets that include attributes like acidity, sugar content, and alcohol levels, the model aims to classify wines into quality ratings. This project is designed for wine enthusiasts, producers, and researchers, providing insights that can aid in improving wine production processes and enhancing quality assessments. Key features include:
Data Analysis: Explore and preprocess wine quality datasets.
Model Training: Utilize algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines for prediction.
Accuracy Assessment: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
